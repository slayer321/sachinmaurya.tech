## Introduction

![](https://i.imgur.com/yaHhBvE.jpg)

Namaste 🙏 , It’s been a while I have been thinking about creating a new website for me but procrastination was always been in my way. Finally, I’m here with the new website I always used to think of what does it feels like to have your portfolio and sharing your life experience with other people.

I will post all the content that I’m learning let it be technical or non-technical and also will like to know your comment on it.
