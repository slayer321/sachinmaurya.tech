Maybe after reading the title, you stumbled upon this notes section that I added today.

Since I pushed the website live back in 2022, just after completing college, my goal was to share the things I learn, and in the process, I might understand them better.

But after almost three years, I believe it didn’t happen the way I thought. Now I think I have a better hold on things, and I will ~~try~~ do whatever brings the best out of me every day. I use Cursor at my work, and it’s really helpful in many ways. For quite a while, I was thinking of using it to upgrade the current website that I have, where the hello-friend-ng Hugo template is used. For now, I think it looks good to me, as I wanted it to be minimal.

About this notes section, I think it will be more of a mix of everything quick notes, learnings, and TIL (Today I Learned), and maybe sometimes a rant as well. Expect it to be raw, as I will dump my thoughts here, and maybe along the way it will make more sense to me as well.
