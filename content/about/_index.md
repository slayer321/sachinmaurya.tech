Hello there 👋, I am **Sachin Maurya** I Graduated from my engineering and currently working a Software Engineer at [velotio](https://www.velotio.com/).
Currently I'm working on a project named [trilio](https://trilio.io/) which is a backup and restore solution for k8s.

I have always been passionate about computers, software programming, and technology as a whole.I was also LFX Mentee for a OpenSource project named KubeArmor were I learned a lot about 
**Kubernetes** security and starting exporing more and now I spend most of my time learning **CNCF tech**  and writing code in **Go** programming language.

Apart from my work and academic, I'm a fitness freak my morning start with my **calisthenics** workout and I also love reading novels. Some of my favorites are by *Haruki Murakami* named *Kafka on the shore* & *Norwegian wood* and many others...

This website is supposed to be a portfolio for all my work/non-work related things and will be updated as I progress in my career.
