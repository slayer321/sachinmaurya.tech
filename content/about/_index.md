Hello there ðŸ‘‹, I am **Sachin Maurya** and I recently Graduated from my engineering and currently working a Associate Product Engineer at [Infracloud](https://www.infracloud.io/).

I have always been passionate about computers, software programming, and technology as a whole. The thrill of building something I envisioned in my mind and watching it work is something Iâ€™ve always been a fan of. Recently, I have been obsessed with how important it is for technology to be used in an ethically right way. Security of systems, user privacy, and ethical use of data are the areas that excite me the most.I was also LFX Mentee for a OpenSource project named KubeArmor were I learned a lot about 
**Kubernetes** security and starting exporing more and now I spend most of my time learning **CNCF tech**  and writing code in **Go** programming language.

Apart from my work and academic, I'm a fitness freak my morning start with my **calisthenics** workout and I also love reading novels. Some of my favorites are by *Haruki Murakami* named *Kafka on the shore* & *Norwegian wood* and many others...

This website is supposed to be a portfolio for all my work/non-work things and will be updated as I progress in my career.
